        Experience how adversaries use Weaponized Affective Vulnerability Engineering (WAVE) to orchestrate synchronized psychological manipulation. This accelerated simulation shows attack patterns that often unfold over weeks in real life — compressed into minutes so you can see the playbook.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Campaign Mode:</strong> Some adversaries don't stop after one contact. They bond, build dependency, and then pivot that emotional leverage into money, data, or access. You'll see that escalation when you choose a campaign sequence.

        <strong>Weaponized Affective Vulnerability Engineering (WAVE)</strong> is the coordinated use of emotional pressure, urgency, belonging, secrecy, guilt, fear, and obligation to steer decisions. The attacker’s goal is to control how you feel so they can control what you do.

          This training simulates real manipulation tactics used in cybercrime, fraud, insider recruitment, romance grooming, and blackmail.
          You’ll see language designed to create panic, shame, guilt, urgency, and secrecy.
          The point is to learn to spot and break those levers in the real world.

        <li><strong>Not Personality Testing:</strong> “Falling for it” here does not mean you're weak. These attacks are industrial. Everyone is targetable.</li>
        <li><strong>Active Learning:</strong> Making a risky choice here is useful. It shows you exactly where you'd feel pressure in real life.</li>
